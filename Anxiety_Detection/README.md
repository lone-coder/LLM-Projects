Anxiety Monitor (Smartwatch App)
The Opportunity: Wearables collect biometric data but rarely utilize it for real-time mental
health monitoring.

What I Built: Consulting with a psychiatrist, I built a wearable app using a TensorFlow Lite
neural network to analyze heart rate and skin temperature for on-device anxiety prediction. It
utilized a hybrid approach, moving from rule-based detection to ML-dominant prediction as it
learned user patterns.

Outcome: During technical due diligence, I identified a critical hardware limitation. Without
galvanic skin response sensors (like in lie detectors), the app could not achieve the accuracy
needed for clinical credibility. I placed the project on hold pending hardware advancements,
choosing to prioritize technical feasibility over concept potential.
