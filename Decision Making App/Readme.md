2. Decisive (Bayesian Decision Support App)
The Opportunity: Current decision tools lack scientific rigor, often relying on simple pro/con
lists.
What I Built: A decision-support app that uses Bayesian conjoint analysis to determine user
preferences. An LLM generates realistic comparison scenarios to update preference probabilities,
while a separate safety layer screens for harmful content.
Outcome: General LLMs like ChatGPT eventually eroded the core value proposition.
Additionally, regulatory failures (e.g. Woebot) in the adjacent digital wellness space signaled
high liability. I shut the project down, recognizing that, much like in CNS opportunity screening,
strong science cannot save a product that fails to survive market evolution or regulatory scrutiny.
