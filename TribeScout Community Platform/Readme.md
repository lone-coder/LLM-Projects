1. TribeScout (Community Discovery Platform)
The Opportunity: The new pricing of Meetup.com, which dominates the market for finding
offline interest groups, has pushed organizers away, creating a market gap.

What I Built: A full-stack platform using semantic search to match users by concept rather than
exact keywords. I engineered an AI gap analysis tool to query the database and identify unmet
demand, such as locating 500 squash players in Calgary with no active club, and generating
specific groups to fill that void.

Outcome: While unit economics were sound, a venture-backed competitor with a freemium
model aggressively destabilized the market. After making a competitive assessment, I
deprioritized the project to avoid an unsustainable price war.
